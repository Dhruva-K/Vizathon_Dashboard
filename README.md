# Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Subsaharan Regions

## Inspiration
The Covid 19 pandemic shook the world economy and while the focus is on how the developed nations are recovering, the underdeveloped nations of the sub-Saharan Africa are suffering in silence.

## What it does
This is an interactive dashboard that visualizes various economic aspects of the people in 5 African countries between January to March 2020

## My Insights
1. The rate of unemployment is significantly higher than the rate of employment in Kenya, Ivory Coast and South Africa. Mozambique and Nigeria too have a spike in unemployment however it is matched by the number of employed people, suggesting a class divide in these countries. 
2. 60% Men and 58% women who are unemployed lost their job in the pandemic, highlighting the fact that the pandemic has caused a havoc in these regions. 
3. A staggering amount of teachers,farmers and sellers have lost their jobs whereas surprisingly, people involved in small businesses have not been stung by the pandemic. The fact that many teachers have lost their jobs depicts an alarming situation wherein an entire generation of kids is being deprived of education and unlike many parts of the world, online education cannot come to aid in these regions.
4. Most of the people who could retain their jobs saw a deduction in their salaries or there was no change. People in each country saw a huge reduction in their salaries are the breadwinners in their families.
5. As compared to other countries in the world, the amount of people that took Covid loans in order to meet their needs and reduce their economic strain is baffling. Almost everyone is concerned about their expenses and their average monthly requirements are not getting fulfilled.
6. According to the poll, 52% of the Nigerian population believes that the priority of their government is to restore the economy, whereas the number wanes as we see the polls of other countries.

## The backs of Subsaharan Nations, which are already reeling under economic pressure are being broken due to the pandemic and efforts need to be taken to start restoring their economy. We as world citizens should start raising funds for the needy. The Goverment should introduce new aids and funds to bring that glimmer of hope in the lives of the victims. An overall reconstruction of the African economy is the need of the hour!
