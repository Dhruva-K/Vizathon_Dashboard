## Inspiration
The Covid 19 pandemic shook the world economy and while the focus is on how the developed nations are recovering, the underdeveloped nations of the sub-Saharan Africa are suffering in silence.

## What it does
This is an interactive dashboard that visualizes various economic aspects of the people in 5 African countries between January to March 2020

## My Insights
1. The rate of unemployment is significantly higher than the rate of employment in Kenya, Ivory Coast and South Africa. Mozambique and Nigeria too have a spike in unemployment however it is matched by the number of employed people, suggesting a class divide in these countries. 
2. 60% Men and 58% women who are unemployed lost their job in the pandemic, highlighting the fact that the pandemic has caused a havoc in these regions. 
3. A staggering amount of teachers,farmers and sellers have lost their jobs whereas surprisingly, people involved in small businesses have not been stung by the pandemic. The fact that many teachers have lost their jobs depicts an alarming situation wherein an entire generation of kids is being deprived of education and unlike many parts of the world, online education cannot come to aid in these regions.
